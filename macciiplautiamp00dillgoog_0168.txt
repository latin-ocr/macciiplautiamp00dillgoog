NOTES.

Msacus Acc1us Pinunus was a nadre ot Sarsina,
asmall town in Umbria. Hc was probably oi obscure
porentoge, and as some suppose, the 'son of a slave.
Of the circumstances of his life very little is known.
He came to Rome, and obtained not only fame, but
emolument, from his dramatic compositions, which
were represented about the middle of the sixth cen-
tury from the foundation of the city. A. Gellius rc-
lntes‚ from the authority of Varro, that Plautus, having
acquired property, was tempted, in order to increase
it, to engags in trude, and that his speculatione suc·
oeeded so ill, that hs was reduced, in a time oi general
scarcity, to employ himself as a laborer to grind ut
the mill. His mind, however, seems to have remained
uudepressed, for he composed three of his comedies
in this toilsome occupatiori. Cicero informs us that
he died in the consulate of Claudius Pulcher and L.
Porcius Licinius, B. C. 184. A great many comedies
were aucicntly current under the popular name oi
Plautus, but oi these, the chief part were only re·
touched by him. 'l'hs best Roman critice admitted
only twenty-six as of his genuine composition, twenty

oi which are still extant, hut some in afimutilated
