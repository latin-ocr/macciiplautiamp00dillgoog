Ριιιιοι.

———

A smenon from the best Latin
Classics would bc singularly incomplete
is it did not contain some portion of the
writings of Plautus. The comedies of

ι this author abound in striking precepts

of morality, ιιι exemplifications of national
manners and customS, and in allusions to
every circumstance of lise. A great vari-
etyis obscrved in his plotS‚ and the rich
vein of humor which distinguishes them
has been imitated, but not cxceeded‚ by
subsequent dramatic composition& The
wit and diction are clearly Ronian, and
peculiar to the author3 both have been

admired hya Cicero and a Caesar.
